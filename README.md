# Simulation_Course_project
The final project of Simulation Course: an implement of Challenger Space Shuttle Problem in Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Methods for Hackers, Chapter 2: A little more on PyMC.
## The book: 

https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers

The book uses Python package, pymc, to solve this problem, but, as the requirement of project, instead of using Pymc, I simply use MCMC sampling to solve the problem, Besides, I try to build a different model from the book. Finally, I use cross-validation to evalute the model I constructed.
